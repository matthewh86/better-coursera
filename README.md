# better-coursera-chrome

Better three column layout for Coursera video lectures. Transcript appears on the right, and downloads are shifted to the left.
Changes the layout of the courseera video pages so that the transcript appears alongside the video, allowing easy access to the video and the transcript.

I'm no expert with CSS or HTML, but the layout on coursera is appalling enough to get me to make this extension so that watching a video and reading the transcript is actually possible.
